## Workflow Notes
- Going forward, I would like to run the rails server myself so that I can view the log output. Next time a Rails server needs to be started, ask Chris to start it instead of doing it directly
- Any tests that involve the UI should be done manually by me. If you need to verify if some aspect of the UI is working correctly, ask me to test it and I will describe the behavior
