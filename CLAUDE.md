# Tvdbcalendar Rails Development with ClaudeOnRails

This project uses ClaudeOnRails to create an intelligent swarm of AI agents specialized in different aspects of Rails development.

## Project Overview

- **Application**: Tvdbcalendar
- **Rails Version**: 8.0.2
- **Ruby Version**: 3.2.2
- **Type**: Full-stack Rails application
- **Test Framework**: Minitest

## How to Use

Simply describe what you want to build or fix, and the swarm will automatically coordinate the implementation:

```bash
# Start the swarm
claude-swarm orchestrate

# Then just describe your task
claude "Add user authentication with email confirmation"
claude "Optimize the dashboard queries that are running slowly"
claude "Create an API endpoint for mobile app integration"
```

## Swarm Architecture

The following specialized agents work together to implement your requests:

- **Architect**: Coordinates all development and makes high-level decisions
- **Models**: Handles ActiveRecord models, migrations, and database design
- **Controllers**: Manages request handling, routing, and controller logic
- **Views**: Creates and maintains views, layouts, and partials
- **Stimulus**: Implements interactive features with Stimulus controllers
- **Services**: Extracts business logic into service objects
- **Jobs**: Handles background processing and async tasks
- **Tests**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage with Minitest
- **DevOps**: Manages deployment and production configurations

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices
- Use RuboCop for Ruby style enforcement
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code

### Testing
- Minitest for all tests
- Fixtures or factories for test data
- Integration tests for user flows
- Unit tests for models and services

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for new work
- Descriptive commit messages
- PR reviews before merging
- Keep main branch deployable

## Custom Patterns

### Privacy and Security
- **User Identification**: ALWAYS use TheTVDB PINs instead of database user IDs in:
  - Routes (e.g., `/calendar/:pin` not `/calendar/:user_id`)
  - Frontend JavaScript (user_pin not user_id)
  - ActionCable channels (user_pin parameter)
  - Background job parameters
  - API responses (user_pin field)
- **Why**: Sequential user IDs are easily guessable and expose user data to unauthorized access
- **Implementation**: Use `User.find_by!(pin: params[:pin])` in controllers, pass PINs to jobs/channels

- **PIN Security**: Treat TheTVDB PINs like passwords - NEVER log actual PIN values
  - Use database user IDs for logging instead: `"Starting sync for user ID #{@user.id}"`
  - Frontend: Log actions without PIN values: `"PIN entered"` not `"PIN entered: #{pin}"`
  - ActionCable: Log channel subscriptions without PINs: `"User subscribed to channel"`
  - **Why**: PINs are sensitive authentication credentials that could be misused if exposed in logs
  - **Exception**: PINs can be used functionally (API calls, channel names) but not in log messages

### Service Objects
```yaml
Services:
  Pattern: Command pattern with Result objects
  Location: app/services/
  Naming: VerbNoun (e.g., CreateOrder, SendEmail)
  Testing: Unit tests with mocked dependencies
```

- This configuration was generated by ClaudeOnRails
- Customize agent prompts in `.claude-on-rails/prompts/`
- Update this file with project-specific conventions
- The swarm learns from your codebase patterns
